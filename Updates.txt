I have successfully implemented the requested enhancements to the EduEats application. Here's a summary of the changes:

Quantity Adjustment in Cart:

Updated CartContext.tsx to include an updateQuantity function.
Modified ShoppingCart.tsx to allow users to increase or decrease item quantities.
Order Confirmation Page:

Created a new page at src/app/order-confirmation/page.tsx.
This page displays detailed information about a specific order after checkout.
User Account Page with Order History:

Created a new page at src/app/account/page.tsx.
This page displays the user's order history with links to individual order details.
Layout Update:

Modified src/app/layout.tsx to include a link to the new account page in the navigation bar.
To test these new features:

Quantity Adjustment:

Add items to your cart from the menu page.
Open the cart and use the "+" and "-" buttons to adjust item quantities.
Order Confirmation:

Complete a checkout process.
You will be automatically redirected to the order confirmation page.
User Account and Order History:

Log in to your account.
Click on the "Account" link in the navigation bar.
View your order history on the account page.
Click on any order to see its details on the order confirmation page.
These enhancements provide a more complete e-commerce experience for your users. The shopping cart now allows for easy quantity adjustments, users can review their orders after checkout, and they have access to their full order history through their account page.

To further improve the application, you might consider:

Adding user profile management (e.g., updating personal information, changing passwords)
Implementing a rating and review system for orders
Creating a favorites or quick reorder feature for frequently ordered items
These additional features would further enhance the user experience and engagement with the EduEats platform.
